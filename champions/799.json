Similarly, if the suppression is removed, so is the attachment.\nIf the target resists the suppression by being  immune to crowd control,  displacement immune, or having a  spell shield, Ambessa will not attach them to herself.\nShe will be unable to apply the damage and stun in this case since the suppression was not applied in the first place.\nShe will still  blink to the target in this case.\nIf the target removes the suppression by any means, including with an applicable  cleanse effect or  dispel, they will instantly detach themselves from Ambessa, which causes the ability to cancel immediately.\nShe will fail to apply the damage and stun to the target since the suppression was removed from them early in this case.\nHer lockout and displacement immunity also ends prematurely in this case.\nIf Ambessa would blink inside the  attack range of an enemy  turret, including the Nexus Obelisk, Public Execution will instead attempt to position her outside of it.\nAmbessa will  reveal herself during the cast time if there is an enemy champion nearby.\nAmbessa will search for enemies in the direction she is facing at the end of cast time.\nThis direction can be changed by  Seraphine's  Encore.(bug)\nIf Ambessa successfully seizes a target, any regular movement commands issued before doing so are discarded upon the lockout ending.\nThis does not affect movement orders issued during the lockout.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Ambessa is in cast time and during the lockout:\nThe cast time is not interrupted by entering  resurrection.\n\n\nAttacking\n\nRegisters input for  Drakehound's Step.\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nRegisters input for  Drakehound's Step.\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
