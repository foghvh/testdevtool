The replicated missile acquires the original missile source as the target.\nIf the original missile was fired by a unit or auto-targeted effect, the replicated missile will be fired as a homing missile with the target being the original missile source.\nHealing projectiles, such as  Soraka's  Rejuvenation and  Sona's  Aria of Perseverance, will instead target Mel.\nIf the original missile was fired via any other targeting paradigm, the replicated missile will by default fire in the direction of the original missile source at the time of replication. This includes vector-targeted projectiles (currently only  Viktor's  Hextech Ray), for which the origin will always be Mel's center (since she cannot control the cast point).\nThe replicated missile will mimic all of the functions of and copy the behavior of the original missile, unless otherwise stated. This includes every aspect and effect of the missile conforming to the attack or spell from which the missile originated.\nThe scaling of the effects of the copied missile is calculated using the original missile source's attributes (namely their stats). The damage of the missile only benefits from Mel's damage modifiers and magic penetration, and not the original source's.\nThe following missiles are destroyed, but not replicated:\n Draven's  Whirling Death\n Illaoi's  Test of Spirit\n Sylas'  Hijack\n Xayah's  Bladecaller and  Featherstorm\n Zac's  Stretching Strikes",
